<h1>Overview</h1>

Stary AI is a web APP that enables users to enter a prompt, such as a character or a subject, which is then used to generate a story using the ChatGPT API. Users can also choose a style of image for each paragraph in the created story, which is generated using Dalle 2. Additionally, users can select a narrative voice, which can be that of a celebrity or even an anime character. The story text is then sent to FakeYou, which returns an audio file in the chosen character's voice. Finally, the application creates a video that displays images with the narration for the user to enjoy.

The APP combines various AI technologies such as natural language processing, computer vision, and text-to-speech to create a unique and personalized user experience. It could potentially be used for various purposes such as entertainment, education, or marketing.
